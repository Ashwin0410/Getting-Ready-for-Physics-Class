# Getting Ready for Physics Class

A Python program that provides reusable functions for fundamental **physics calculations**.  
Ideal for students and teachers to quickly compute common physical properties.

## Features
- Defines functions to calculate:
  - Force  
  - Work and energy  
  - Motion-related formulas (e.g., speed, acceleration)
- Demonstrates function creation, parameters, and return values

## How to Run
```bash
python physics_class.py
